If there are no workouts available, return to the main menu and reach the required record, try to keep your concentration at the highest possible level.</string>
    <string name="teachingTrainingProgress">When a penguin trains, progress is displayed above its head.</string>
    <string name="teachingConcentrationTraining">By pressing the swing button you can increase the penguin\'s concentration during training. The higher the concentration, the less time it will take to complete the training.</string>
    <string name="teachingBackToMainMenu">Training is complete! Your penguin has become a little stronger! Check how high he can fly now by returning to the main menu using this button.</string>
